 jdbc.sqlonly	Logs only SQL. SQL executed within a prepared statement is automatically shown with it's bind arguments replaced with the data bound at that position, for greatly increased readability.
 jdbc.sqltiming	Logs the SQL, post-execution, including timing statistics on how long the SQL took to execute.
 jdbc.audit	Logs ALL JDBC calls except for ResultSets. This is a very voluminous output, and is not normally needed unless tracking down a specific JDBC problem.
 jdbc.resultset	Even more voluminous, because all calls to ResultSet objects are logged.
 jdbc.resultsettable	Log the jdbc results as a table. Level debug will fill in unread values in the result set.
 jdbc.connection	Logs connection open and close events as well as dumping all open connection numbers. This is very useful for hunting down connection leak problems.
